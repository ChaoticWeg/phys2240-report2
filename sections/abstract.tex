We used a magnetic field sensor to measure the axial and radial components of the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying coil. We calculate that the magnetic field strength of our solenoid is between 22.016 and 26.420 mT. In gathering our data, the magnetic field sensor was not kept exactly in line with the vertical axis of the coil, introducing the radial component of the field vector into our axial field data and causing discrepancies in the data.
