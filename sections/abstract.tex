We used a magnetic field sensor to measure the axial and radial components of the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying coil. We found that the magnetic field strength of our coil is less than the calculated bound values of 22.016 mT and 26.420 mT, indicating that the magnetic field of the coil more closely resembles that of a short solenoid. In gathering our data, the magnetic field sensor was not kept exactly in line with the vertical axis of the coil, introducing a non-zero radial component and causing discrepancies in the data.
