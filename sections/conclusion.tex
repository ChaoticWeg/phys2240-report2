We conclude that the magnetic field is aligned with the axis of the coil up until the ends of the coil, at which point the positive end of the field curves around and "re-enters" the coil at the negative end. We found the coil to behave more like a short solenoid than a long solenoid, with magnetic field strength less than that of either model.

Our failure to keep the sensor probe aligned with the axis of the coil introduced a non-zero radial component to the magnetic field and thus introduced a major source of error in several of the runs. Correcting this error would improve the accuracy of the results greatly; however, this is not an indication that the method used is inaccurate or imprecise.
